**Can we use remote sensing datasets to investigate the impact of wind extremes on carbon cycling in forests?**

Past studies have shown that disturbances such as fire can have a significant impact on carbon cycling, yet the impact of wind extremes on carbon cycling is largely unknown.  Using Hurricanes Irma and Maria (September - October 2017) as a case study, I investigate the feasibility of observing changes in aboveground biomass after intense storm events through vegetation optical depth, a measure of canopy density from microwave remote sensing.  I compare changes in aboveground biomass to maximum wind speeds during the hurricane to investigate the relationship between wind speeds and biomass loss.  

Datasets:
- [Wind speeds from ERA5 (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)
- [Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) from SMOS (European Space Agency)](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/smos)
