Can we use remote sensing datasets to investigate the impact of wind extremes on carbon cycling in forests?

[Wind speeds from ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)

[Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) from SMOS](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/smos)

Using Hurricane Maria (September - October 2017) as a case study, I will see if it is possible to observe a change in aboveground biomass before and after the storm through vegetation optical depth, a measure of canopy density from microwave remote sensing.  I will compare changes in aboveground biomass to maximum wind speeds during the hurricane to investigate the relationship between wind speeds and biomass loss.
